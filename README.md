# Eisenhower-Matrix

This is my very first JavaScript project.

Whenever someone is learning JavaScript, they start by creating a To-do list. Unlike them, I wanted to go some steps further and create an Eisenhower-Matrix project. It is similar to To-do lists but the thing that differenciates it from other To-do lists is that Eisenhower Matrix has 4 boxes with 4 different task priorities:

Important and Urgent.
Important but not Urgent.
Not important but Urgent.
Neither important nor Urgent.
You can put your tasks through a form that I have created.

------------------
LEARNING OUTCOMES:

How to create functions in JavaScript.
How to switch between CSS classes using JavaScript.
How to create new elements and display them in each
How to show warning/sucess message after clicking on the submit button.
